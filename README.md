ðŸŽ¨ #Text-to-Image Generator using Stable Diffusion

Turn any text prompt into stunning images in seconds! This project uses Stable Diffusion to generate images from text prompts with a simple web-based interface built using Gradio.

ðŸ”¥ Features

Generate images from any text prompt

Choose different styles for your images (Realistic, Cartoon, etc.)

Specify the number of images to generate

Fast and interactive frontend using Gradio

ðŸ’» Requirements

Python 3.10+

NVIDIA GPU recommended for fast image generation

Running on CPU is possible, but it will be very slow

Internet connection (to download pretrained models)


#Install dependencies:

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate pillow torch torchvision torchaudio gradio -q

ðŸš€ #Usage

Run the app:

python app.py


Open the Gradio interface in your browser

Enter a text prompt, choose style and number of images, then click Generate

âš¡ Example

Prompt: A cat wearing sunglasses on the beach
Style: Realistic
Number of Images: 1

The app generates the image in seconds (faster on GPU).

ðŸ’¡ #Notes

GPU is highly recommended for fast generation

You can experiment with different prompts and styles

Make sure you have enough RAM and storage for model weights
